## Step 7: Create Releases

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Production-ready UCL Draw Simulator

Features:
- Complete constraint satisfaction implementation
- Two web interfaces
- Docker support
- CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation"

git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Step 8: Add Shields/Badges to README

Your README already includes these badges:
- Python version
- License
- Code style

You can add more after first push:
- Build status: `[![CI](https://github.com/yourusername/repo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/repo/actions)`
- GitHub stars: `[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yourusername/repo.svg)](https://github.com/yourusername/repo/stargazers)`

## Step 9: Portfolio Website Integration

If you have a portfolio website, add:

```html
<div class="project">
  <h3>UEFA Champions League Draw Simulator</h3>
  <p>Production-ready constraint satisfaction algorithm with web visualization</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solves complex CSP with 5 simultaneous constraints</li>
    <li>95% test coverage with 17 comprehensive unit tests</li>
    <li>Modern web UI with dual visualization modes</li>
    <li>Docker + CI/CD + comprehensive documentation</li>
  </ul>

## Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project:

1. **Algorithm Design**: "I implemented a constraint satisfaction problem solver using randomized backtracking..."

2. **Testing**: "I achieved 95% test coverage with 17 unit tests covering edge cases..."

3. **Architecture**: "I designed a modular architecture with separated concerns..."

4. **Performance**: "The algorithm achieves 95%+ success rate within 5000 attempts..."

5. **DevOps**: "I containerized the application and set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions..."

6. **Trade-offs**: "I chose zero dependencies for maximum portability, even though libraries could simplify some tasks..."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why no frameworks?**
A: To demonstrate core JavaScript skills and keep the project lightweight and portable.

**Q: Why Python standard library only?**
A: Maximizes portability, reduces security concerns, and demonstrates deep knowledge of Python.

**Q: How would you scale this?**
A: Database for history, API layer for services, parallel processing for multiple draws, caching for common patterns.

**Q: What would you improve?**
A: ML to optimize attempt strategies, advanced analytics, mobile app, RESTful API.
